 Projects that i undertook to advance Data Science knowldege.  
 
 ## 911 Calls Project 
 This project was for analyzing 911 calls from data from kaggle which i did while completing 
 a course on how to use the Data Science Libraries in Python. 
 
 After Analysing the Data, i realized that the number one reason for 911 calls was for 
 Back pain and health issues followed by Traffic and then Fire. It was quite interesting 
 to see that during the holidays the nuber of 911 calls dropped significantly for all three
 reasons. And lastly most calls were done during the week with having the majority of calls
 happening around 3-5 pm. 
 
 Knowing these insights into the data, the police department could use this in many different
 ways to serve their community even better. They could firstly have more people on duty around 
 3-5 pm, they could invest in advanced medical first aid equipment, and even more analysis can be done
 to see which locations had the most calls and have staff deployed near that area for faster response time.
 This can go further to even helping the staff by having less staff during the low volume months and days 
 giving the staff time freedom. 
 
 The libraries used where:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - cufflinks
 - plotly
