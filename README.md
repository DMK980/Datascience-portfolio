 Projects that i undertook to advance Data Science knowldege.  
 
 ## 911 Calls Project 
 This project was for analyzing 911 calls from data from kaggle which i did while completing 
 a course on how to use the Data Science Libraries in Python. 
 
 After Analysing the Data, i realized that the number one reason for 911 calls was for 
 Back pain and health issues followed by Traffic and then Fire. It was quite interesting 
 to see that during the holidays the nuber of 911 calls dropped significantly for all three
 reasons. And lastly most calls were done during the week with having the majority of calls
 happening around 3-5 pm. 
 
 The libraries used where:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - cufflinks
 - plotly
